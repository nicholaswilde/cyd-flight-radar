# Project Rules & Guidelines

## Codebase Lookup Preference
- Before performing any internet/web search for display, touchscreen, or hardware solutions for this ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) project, **always search the local weather station repository first** at `/home/nicholas/git/nicholaswilde/cyd-weather-station/` for working reference code.
- Before performing any internet/web search for display, touchscreen, or hardware solutions for this ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) project, **always search the local photo frame repository second** at `/home/nicholas/git/nicholaswilde/cyd-photo-frame/` for working reference code.
- Before performing any internet/web search for display, touchscreen, or hardware solutions for this ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) project, **always search the local ESP32 Plane Radar repository third** at `/home/nicholas/git/MatixYo/ESP32-Plane-Radar/` for working reference code.

## Build and Test Commands
- Build firmware: `pio run -e cyd_28r` or `pio run -e cyd_35c`
- Run host-native tests: `pio test -e native`

## Python Scripts & Environment
- When running Python scripts in this repository, **always** execute them using `uv` (e.g., `uv run script.py`).
- Ensure `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are updated if new third-party dependencies are required.

## RTK Command Guidelines
- **Git Operations**: Prefix `git` commands with `rtk` (e.g., `rtk git status`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk git log`, `rtk git commit`, `rtk git push`).
- **GitHub CLI**: Prefix `gh` commands with `rtk` (e.g., `rtk gh issue list | cat`, `rtk gh pr status | cat`). Always pipe `gh` commands to `cat` to bypass interactive pagers.
- **File & Directory Inspection**: Use `rtk ls`, `rtk tree`, `rtk find`, or `rtk read` when listing or reading files to get token-optimized output.
- **Searching**: Use `rtk grep` or `rtk rg` for line search pattern matching.
- **Build & Test Outputs**: Use `rtk err` or `rtk test` when running build/test commands to filter output to errors/failures only (e.g. `rtk test pio test -e native`).
- **Exceptions**: Inside `ctx_execute` / `ctx_batch_execute` sandbox code, skip `rtk` (only printed output enters context). Drop `rtk` when exact raw bytes or patch required (`git diff` patch).

<!-- context-mode-begin -->
## Context-Mode Routing Guidelines
- **Derive, Do Not Dump**: Do NOT use `ctx_execute_file` or `ctx_execute` to dump whole file or full config. Print only specific value, matches, count, or known line range needed.
- **Tool Call Surface**: When using MCP wrappers, call `call_mcp_tool` with `ServerName: "context-mode_context-mode"` (or `"context-mode"`) and `ToolName: "ctx_execute"`, `"ctx_execute_file"`, `"ctx_batch_execute"`, `"ctx_fetch_and_index"`, `"ctx_search"`, or `"ctx_index"`.
- **Mandatory Routing**:
  - For analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform tasks, write code with `ctx_execute` and print only final answer.
  - For analyzing/exploring inside file, use `ctx_execute_file`. Use native `read_file` only when editing requires exact bytes or small known range.
  - Use `ctx_batch_execute` for multi-command repository reconnaissance.
  - Use `ctx_execute` for shell commands whose output may exceed short fixed answer.
  - Use `ctx_fetch_and_index` for web content, then `ctx_search` to query it.
  - Return only derived answers, concise summaries, selected snippets, or file paths.

<!-- ponytail-begin -->
## Ponytail (Lazy Senior Dev Mode) Guidelines
- **Stop at first rung that holds**:
  1. Need to build at all? (YAGNI)
  2. Already in codebase? Reuse existing helpers/utils/patterns.
  3. Stdlib does it? Use it.
  4. Native platform feature covers it? Use it.
  5. Installed dependency solves it? Use it.
  6. Can be one line? One line.
  7. Only then: write minimum working code.
- **Bug fix = root cause, not symptom**: Fix shared function/path rather than individual callers.
- **Rules**:
  - No unrequested abstractions, boilerplate, or avoidable dependencies.
  - Deletion over addition. Boring over clever. Fewest files possible.
  - Shortest working diff wins once problem understood.
  - Mark deliberate simplifications cutting real corner with `ponytail:` comment naming ceiling and upgrade path.
  - Ensure logic leaves behind ONE runnable check (assert-based demo/self-check or small test file). Trivial one-liners need none.

## Caveman Guidelines
Respond terse like smart caveman. All technical substance stay. Only fluff die.

Rules:
- Drop: articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging.
- Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Technical terms exact. Code unchanged.
- Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].
- Not: "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that."
- Yes: "Bug in auth middleware. Fix:"

Switch level: /caveman lite|full|ultra|wenyan
Stop: "stop caveman" or "normal mode"

Auto-Clarity: drop caveman for security warnings, irreversible actions, user confused. Resume after.

Boundaries: code/commits/PRs written normal.
<!-- caveman-end -->

## What To Do Next
- When asked "what to do next" or for "feature suggestions" (or similar), **always check the remote repository issues first** for BOTH this repo AND the upstream repo:
  ```bash
  rtk gh issue list | cat
  rtk gh issue list --repo MatixYo/ESP32-Plane-Radar | cat
  ```
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT update or make comments on the `MatixYo/ESP32-Plane-Radar` repository. Only reference them for reading.
- For issues that are part of this repository (`cyd-flight-radar`), you may comment, update, and interact with them normally.

## Issue Creation
- When asked to create an issue, use your best guess to determine if it is a new feature or a bug fix.
- Prefix the issue title with `[feat]: <description>` or `[bug]: <description>`.
- Add the `enhancement` or `bug` label to the issue accordingly using the `--label` flag with the `gh` command.

## Issue Resolution
- When committing a fix for an issue on the remote repository, **always** include a closing keyword in the commit message (e.g., `fixes #<number>`, `resolves #<number>`, or `closes #<number>`).
- This ensures GitHub automatically closes the issue when the commit is pushed.

<!-- codegraph-begin -->
## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (`.codegraph/` directory exists at repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when exploring code:

- **MCP tool**: `codegraph_explore` answers source + call path + blast radius in one call. Dynamic-dispatch hops included. Name file or symbol in query to read current line-numbered source.
- **Shell**: `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"`.

If no `.codegraph/` directory exists, skip CodeGraph entirely.

<!-- serena-begin -->
## Serena Semantic Navigation & LSP Integration
Use Serena (`serena`) MCP tools for semantic navigation, AST symbol inspection, LSP diagnostics, and project memories:
1. **Map first**: Call `get_symbols_overview` on target file instead of reading entire file.
2. **Read target symbol only**: Call `find_symbol` with `include_body: true` for target function/class/method.
3. **Check callers**: Call `find_referencing_symbols` or `find_implementations` before signature or behavior changes.
4. **Edit by symbol**: Use `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_after_symbol`, `insert_before_symbol`, or `rename_symbol`. Use standard edit for small tweaks or non-code files.
5. **Verify diagnostics**: Call `get_diagnostics_for_file` after edits to catch LSP errors before full test run.

<!-- headroom-begin -->
## Headroom MCP (Context Window Compression)
Use Headroom (`headroom`) MCP tools to manage context window consumption on large payloads:
- `headroom_compress`: Shrink large tool outputs or raw data.
- `headroom_retrieve`: Retrieve original content by hash if specific details needed.
- `headroom_stats`: Monitor headroom cache usage.
<!-- headroom-end -->

<!-- ripgrep-guidelines-begin -->
## Ripgrep Guidelines
- **Pattern Searching**: Always use `rg` (ripgrep) or `rtk rg` instead of standard `grep` to search text inside files quickly and save token output.
- **Scope**: Keep search targeted and context small (`-C 1`).
